ALU only supports the following operations:
A + B
A AND B
A
NOT A

N is set when the ALU output is negative
Z is set when the ALU output is zero

The ALU output then goes into the shifter, which can shift it 1 bit either direction.
Possible to left shift 2 bits if you do R + R in the ALU, then shift left using the shifter.

MULT:
