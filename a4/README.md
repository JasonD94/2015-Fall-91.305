3.5 MIC-1 Microcode Extension
==============================
For this assignment we created three new microcode instructions for the MIC-1.

I first started off by running the rshift code from Prof. Moloney's a4 help directory,
and started modifying the masm assembler code. I added new cases in the .c file,
and new cases in the flex file as well. I also added new definitions for the cases
in the header file. At this point I began to write the multiplication code and that
took several hours to get working. I also started working on the division code as well.

Multiplication was difficult to figure out. Division was even more difficult,
with many cases to account for compared to multiplication.
