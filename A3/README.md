MIC-1 Fibonacci
==========
This program will do the following:

"In MIC1 assembly, write a program that computes the first 25 Fibonacci numbers (modulo 2^15)
and stores them into memory. You must provide a function that can receive as an argument any
number between 0 and 25 and return its Fibonacci number. You could use this function to populate
the table. Since you can’t yet print anything on the MIC1, you’ll have to end with a HALT instruction
and use the debugger to show that the program worked correctly."
